Chamber integration notes

We'd like to reserve a block of space, 200x200x20mm in the center of the chamber for our apparatus. Nothing should overhang this footprint.
We'd like 11 M6 threaded (standard, 1.0mm pitch) holes made 6mm deep into the thermal plate.
Holes at positions (in mm, assuming the center of the thermal plate is location 0,0):

The attached files, engineering_sketch.pdf and the 3d step file model in space_claim.zip show this.
The step file also has details on how the electrical connections should be made.
Accepts standard 2x20 0.100" pitch IDC connectors.
The connectors (there are two of them) will be HTSS-120-04-G-D-RA by Samtec.
