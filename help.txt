Build Python packages into source distributions and wheels.

`uv build` accepts a path to a directory or source distribution, which defaults to the current working directory.

By default, if passed a directory, `uv build` will build a source distribution ("sdist") from the source directory, and a binary distribution ("wheel") from the source distribution.

`uv build --sdist` can be used to build only the source distribution, `uv build --wheel` can be used to build only the binary distribution, and `uv build --sdist --wheel` can be used to build both distributions from source.

If passed a source distribution, `uv build --wheel` will build a wheel from the source distribution.

Usage: uv build [OPTIONS] [SRC]

Arguments:
  [SRC]
          The directory from which distributions should be built, or a source distribution archive to build into a wheel.
          
          Defaults to the current working directory.

Options:
      --package <PACKAGE>
          Build a specific package in the workspace.
          
          The workspace will be discovered from the provided source directory, or the current directory if no source directory is provided.
          
          If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

      --all-packages
          Builds all packages in the workspace.
          
          The workspace will be discovered from the provided source directory, or the current directory if no source directory is provided.
          
          If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

  -o, --out-dir <OUT_DIR>
          The output directory to which distributions should be written.
          
          Defaults to the `dist` subdirectory within the source directory, or the directory containing the source distribution archive.

      --sdist
          Build a source distribution ("sdist") from the given directory

      --wheel
          Build a binary distribution ("wheel") from the given directory

      --no-build-logs
          Hide logs from the build backend

      --force-pep517
          Always build through PEP 517, don't use the fast path for the uv build backend.
          
          By default, uv won't create a PEP 517 build environment for packages using the uv build backend, but use a fast path that calls into the build backend directly. This option forces always using PEP 517.

  -b, --build-constraints <BUILD_CONSTRAINTS>
          Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building distributions.
          
          Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a build dependency that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the inclusion of that package on its own.
          
          [env: UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT=]

      --require-hashes
          Require a matching hash for each requirement.
          
          By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.
          
          When `--require-hashes` is enabled, _all_ requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and _all_ requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., `==1.0.0`), or be specified via direct URL.
          
          Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:
          
          - Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installs are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (`.whl`) or source archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`), as opposed to a directory.
          
          [env: UV_REQUIRE_HASHES=]

      --no-verify-hashes
          Disable validation of hashes in the requirements file.
          
          By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash. To enforce hash validation, use `--require-hashes`.
          
          [env: UV_NO_VERIFY_HASHES=]

Python options:
  -p, --python <PYTHON>
          The Python interpreter to use for the build environment.
          
          By default, builds are executed in isolated virtual environments. The discovered interpreter
          will be used to create those environments, and will be symlinked or copied in depending on
          the platform.
          
          See `uv help python` to view supported request formats.
          
          [env: UV_PYTHON=]

      --managed-python
          Require use of uv-managed Python versions.
          
          By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.
          
          [env: UV_MANAGED_PYTHON=]

      --no-managed-python
          Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.
          
          Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.
          
          [env: UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON=]

      --no-python-downloads
          Disable automatic downloads of Python. [env: "UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never"]

Index options:
      --index <INDEX>
          The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.
          
          Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.
          
          All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.
          
          [env: UV_INDEX=]

      --default-index <DEFAULT_INDEX>
          The URL of the default package index (by default: <https://pypi.org/simple>).
          
          Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.
          
          The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.
          
          [env: UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=]

  -i, --index-url <INDEX_URL>
          (Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: <https://pypi.org/simple>).
          
          Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.
          
          The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.
          
          [env: UV_INDEX_URL=]

      --extra-index-url <EXTRA_INDEX_URL>
          (Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.
          
          Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.
          
          All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.
          
          [env: UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=]

  -f, --find-links <FIND_LINKS>
          Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.
          
          If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.
          
          If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.
          
          [env: UV_FIND_LINKS=]

      --no-index
          Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

      --index-strategy <INDEX_STRATEGY>
          The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.
          
          By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same
          name to an alternate index.
          
          [env: UV_INDEX_STRATEGY=]

          Possible values:
          - first-index:        Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
          - unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
          - unsafe-best-match:  Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

      --keyring-provider <KEYRING_PROVIDER>
          Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.
          
          At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.
          
          Defaults to `disabled`.
          
          [env: UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=]

          Possible values:
          - disabled:   Do not use keyring for credential lookup
          - subprocess: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

Resolver options:
  -U, --upgrade
          Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies `--refresh`

  -P, --upgrade-package <UPGRADE_PACKAGE>
          Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies `--refresh-package`

      --resolution <RESOLUTION>
          The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.
          
          By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).
          
          [env: UV_RESOLUTION=]

          Possible values:
          - highest:       Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
          - lowest:        Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
          - lowest-direct: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

      --prerelease <PRERELEASE>
          The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.
          
          By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).
          
          [env: UV_PRERELEASE=]

          Possible values:
          - disallow:                 Disallow all pre-release versions
          - allow:                    Allow all pre-release versions
          - if-necessary:             Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
          - explicit:                 Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
          - if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

      --fork-strategy <FORK_STRATEGY>
          The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.
          
          By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.
          
          Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.
          
          [env: UV_FORK_STRATEGY=]

          Possible values:
          - fewest:          Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
          - requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

      --exclude-newer <EXCLUDE_NEWER>
          Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.
          
          Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.
          
          [env: UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER=]

      --no-sources
          Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

Build options:
  -C, --config-setting <CONFIG_SETTING>
          Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as `KEY=VALUE` pairs

      --no-build-isolation
          Disable isolation when building source distributions.
          
          Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.
          
          [env: UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=]

      --no-build-isolation-package <NO_BUILD_ISOLATION_PACKAGE>
          Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.
          
          Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

      --no-build
          Don't build source distributions.
          
          When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.
          
          [env: UV_NO_BUILD=]

      --no-build-package <NO_BUILD_PACKAGE>
          Don't build source distributions for a specific package
          
          [env: UV_NO_BUILD_PACKAGE=]

      --no-binary
          Don't install pre-built wheels.
          
          The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.
          
          [env: UV_NO_BINARY=]

      --no-binary-package <NO_BINARY_PACKAGE>
          Don't install pre-built wheels for a specific package
          
          [env: UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE=]

Installer options:
      --link-mode <LINK_MODE>
          The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.
          
          This option is only used when building source distributions.
          
          Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.
          
          [env: UV_LINK_MODE=]

          Possible values:
          - clone:    Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
          - copy:     Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
          - hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
          - symlink:  Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

Cache options:
  -n, --no-cache
          Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation
          
          [env: UV_NO_CACHE=]

      --cache-dir <CACHE_DIR>
          Path to the cache directory.
          
          Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.
          
          To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.
          
          [env: UV_CACHE_DIR=]

      --refresh
          Refresh all cached data

      --refresh-package <REFRESH_PACKAGE>
          Refresh cached data for a specific package

Global options:
  -q, --quiet...
          Use quiet output.
          
          Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

  -v, --verbose...
          Use verbose output.
          
          You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. (<https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives>)

      --color <COLOR_CHOICE>
          Control the use of color in output.
          
          By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

          Possible values:
          - auto:   Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
          - always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
          - never:  Disables colored output

      --native-tls
          Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.
          
          By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).
          
          However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.
          
          [env: UV_NATIVE_TLS=]

      --offline
          Disable network access.
          
          When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.
          
          [env: UV_OFFLINE=]

      --allow-insecure-host <ALLOW_INSECURE_HOST>
          Allow insecure connections to a host.
          
          Can be provided multiple times.
          
          Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).
          
          WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.
          
          [env: UV_INSECURE_HOST=]

      --no-progress
          Hide all progress outputs.
          
          For example, spinners or progress bars.
          
          [env: UV_NO_PROGRESS=]

      --directory <DIRECTORY>
          Change to the given directory prior to running the command.
          
          Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.
          
          See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

      --project <PROJECT>
          Run the command within the given project directory.
          
          All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).
          
          Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.
          
          See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.
          
          This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.
          
          [env: UV_PROJECT=]

      --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>
          The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.
          
          While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.
          
          [env: UV_CONFIG_FILE=]

      --no-config
          Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).
          
          Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.
          
          [env: UV_NO_CONFIG=]

  -h, --help
          Display the concise help for this command
